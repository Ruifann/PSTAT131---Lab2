# Question 2
#Split the abalone data into a training set and a testing set. Use stratified sampling. You should decide on appropriate percentages for splitting the data.

#Remember that you’ll need to set a seed at the beginning of the document to reproduce your results.
set.seed(6)

```{r}
#Using the training data, create a recipe predicting the outcome variable, age, with all other predictor variables. Note that you should not include rings to predict age. Explain why you shouldn’t use rings to predict age.

#Steps for your recipe:
simple_abalone_recipe <- recipe(age ~ ., data = abalone_train %>% select(-rings))
#dummy code any categorical predictors

#Question 6
#Use your fit() object to predict the age of a hypothetical female abalone with longest_shell = 0.50, diameter = 0.10, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, shell_weight = 1.

```{r}
# Question 7
#Now you want to assess your model’s performance. To do this, use the yardstick package:

#Create a metric set that includes R2, RMSE (root mean squared error), and MAE (mean absolute error).
#Use predict() and bind_cols() to create a tibble of your model’s predicted values from the training data #along with the actual observed ages (these are needed to assess your model’s performance).
#Finally, apply your metric set to the tibble, report the results, and interpret the R2 value.
